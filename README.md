## Overview
In this project the goal is to safely navigate around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit on a simulator provided by Udacity (You can download the Simulator [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2)). The simulator sends car telemetry information like car's localization and sensor fusion data, plus sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. I was able to rwrite a code that make the car go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, note that other cars trying to change lanes too. The car avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it takes a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3. Udacity provides a seed project to start from on this project ([here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Path-Planning-Project)).

#### The map of the highway is in data/highway_map.txt
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

#### uWebSocketIO Starter Guide
The communication between the simulator and the path planner is done using [WebSocket](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket). The path planner uses the [uWebSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets) WebSocket implementation to handle this communication. The package does this by setting up a web socket server connection from the C++ program to the simulator, which acts as the host. [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO.

The particular project implementation was done on **Linux OS** and the rest of this documentation will be focused on Linux OS. The project also support Mac operating system.

In order to install the necessary libraries, from the project repository directory run the script either [install-ubuntu.sh](https://github.com/aliasaswad/CarND-Path-Planning-Project-P7/blob/master/install-ubuntu.sh) for Linux user or  [install-mac.sh](https://github.com/aliasaswad/CarND-Path-Planning-Project-P7/blob/master/install-mac.sh) for Mac user.

```
The Path Planning algorithms is implemented in [`src/main.cpp`](https://github.com/aliasaswad/CarND-Path-Planning-Project-P7/blob/master/src/main.cpp). Inside `data/[highway_map.csv](https://github.com/aliasaswad/CarND-Path-Planning-Project-P7/blob/master/data/highway_map.csv)` there is a list of waypoints that go all the way around the track. The track contains a total of 181 waypoints, with the last waypoint mapping back around to the first. The waypoints are in the middle of the double-yellow dividing line in the center of the highway.

## Running the Code
This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install uWebSocketIO for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu to install uWebSocketIO. Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and ran by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. Create a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
2. Compile:`cmake ..`
3. `make`, this will create executable
    -  `path_planning`, which is our implementation
4. Finally, run `./path_planning`


Alternatively some scripts have been included to streamline this process, these can be leveraged by executing the following in the top directory of the project:
```
$ ./clean.sh
$ ./build.sh
$ ./run.sh
```
To run the particle filter we need to run both `./run.sh` using the terminal and the simulator. The output should be like:

`Listening to port 4567
`

Which means that the implemtation code now connected to the simulator right away.
Run the simulator shoud show the below image:

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

//Note: Return the previous list but with processed points removed, can be a nice tool to show how far along
the path has processed since last time. 

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Details

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3. (NOTE: As this is BETA, these requirements might change. Also currently jerk is over a .02 second interval, it would probably be better to average total acceleration over 1 second and measure jerk from that.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long maybe just 1-3 time steps. During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given, because of this its a good idea to store the last points you have used so you can have a smooth transition. previous_path_x, and previous_path_y can be helpful for this transition since they show the last points given to the simulator controller with the processed points already removed. You would either return a path that extends this previous path or make sure to create a new path that has a smooth transition with this last path.

## Tips

A really helpful resource for doing this project and creating smooth trajectories was using http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/, the spline function is in a single hearder file is really easy to use.

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!


## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
